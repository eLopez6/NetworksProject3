# NetworksProject3
3rd Project for Computer Networks I. Creates a packet trace analyzer with a focus on analyzing the transport layer components of the packets. 
This is Linux only

The packet trace was modified by my professor to remove all personal information from the Application layer and add header information for each packet instead of the normal synchronization info.

To run:
Download the source files, extract the sample output. 
Make 
Run from the terminal: ./proj3 -<p, s, t> -r <input file>

The uploaded PDF assignment description explains what each option does more articulately than me. 

The project does not totaly work:
  -t generates some accurate output and some innaccurate
  I never got the opportunity to fix that part of the project.
